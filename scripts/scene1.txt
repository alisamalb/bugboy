J. “Bugboy... he’s a bug, but also a boy...”
J. “He has to save the planet from... the enemies...”
J. “Which are also bugs!”
Ev. “......”
Jt. “Come on, Jenna, say something! Anything!”
Jt. “Look around and describe things, if you have to!”
Jt. “Let’s see... there’s a desk, a water tank... maybe Bugboy can swim?”
Jt. “No, he’s a bug... they can’t swim. What else is here?”
Jt. “That window... there’s such a good view from up here.”
J. “I can’t do this... I wish I could fly out of here!”
J. “...did I say that out lout? I didn’t mean to... you know, that’s...”
J. “Wait, that’s right!”
J. “That’s what Bugboy said! Back when he was a regular boy!”
Jt. “I can’t stop now, I have to keep going! For Bugboy!”
J. “Ok, picture this: blue skies and milky clouds zooming by...”
J. “...while a cliff peeks from below, seawaves pounding at its feet.”
J. “Suddenly Bugboy, in all it’s many-legged glory, takes to the sky!”
“[Starts idle animation, if we have one]”
Jt. “I can almost see him flying in all directions!”
Jt. “All four, I mean. Poor boy can only move up, down, left and right.”
“[can’t progress until player has moved in all four directions. Underlined text is highlighted in some way]”
J. “He’s soaring trough the skies at an incredible speed, what a sight!”
J. “And I’m riding him!”
J. “(thinking) I can’t say that out loud, but you can’t stop me from dreaming!”
Mr. “Did you just say you’re riding Bugboy?”
J. “What? No!”
J. “(thinking) Oh geez, it happened again!”
J. “I said, ‘I’m writing it.’ As in, ‘I’m writing this down!’“
Ms. “Right...”
N. “Shouldn’t you have wrote this down already?”
Mr. “Hey, you’re right! This is your movie, isn’t it?”
Mr. “You should at least have some notes ready!”
J. “Oh, that... It’s just a figure of speech.”
J. “Like it’s sooo gooood that I’m writing it down. Metaphorically”
Ms. “Never heard anyone say that.”
J. “Well, you heard it now. You’re welcome.”
J. “Why do you even care if I talk a bit weird?”
Ms. “You’re a writer applying for a job. What do you think?”
N. “Everyone, please calm down!”
J and Ms. “...”
N. “Jenna, you can take a moment and continue when you’re ready.”
J. “Thank you. And I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to come off like that.”
J. “...”
J. “As I said, Bugboy has some enemies waiting for him!”
J. “They... are also bugs?”
J. “...”
J. “They come in a bunch of colours and shapes.”
J. “...”
J. “They have all have guns, while Bugboy...”
“[Avoid the bullets]”
Jt. “Sure, Jenna. Giving the bugs a gun, why wouldn’t you?”
J. “Bugboy has a stinger, and he dashes trough the bullets to attack!”
Jt. “Really? A charge attack? ‘Press the B button, Bugboy!’ I hate this.
“[‘Press the B button, Bugboy!’]”
Jt. “It’s happening again. I don’t know what to say...”
J. “Sometimes...”
Jt. “Just talk! Never stop talking!”
Jt. “If you stop talking they’ll realize how stupid this is!”
J. “Sometimes Bugboy gets stuck, when he doesn’t know what to say.”
J. “And when that happens, he looks...”
J. “He looks at the shape of the clouds for inspiration.”
J. “When things get though he charges trough them to keep himself going!”
J. “Now, that’s what I call...”
